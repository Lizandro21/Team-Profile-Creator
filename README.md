# Team Profile Creator!
---
Inside the master branch we have all the code for the tests, dist, lib, src, and the index.js.
---
Everything went smoothly when making this app besides a few bumps with trying to match style sheets with the index.js it kept not linking eventually it started to
work when I tried linking it different ways.
---
The team profile is working you run the index.js then it promts you for the managers name, ID, number etc. After it asks whats your employees position out of engineer
and intern. Then you fill out similar questions in regard to which ever one you pick. After that it promts you if you would like to add any more members. You can keep
adding memebers until you don't need to anymore. After this it pushes the member cards onto the html page and makes a styled card sheet out of your team members.
